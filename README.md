# Tureng-Machine
The tool is translating [EN-TR] or [TR-EN] by using tureng.com
I wrote it to use myself but some of my friend wanted me to share that tool and I published it.

History of Tureng Machine: While I was studying 'Computing Theory', I had to use 'tureng.com' to translate some words. Then, I thinked that why do not I write a program for myself to translate from my Debian terminal and I started coding. The name of it comes from 'Turing Machine' that I studied.
